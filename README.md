# Hide-N-Seek-IRL
Real time hide and go seek mobile game. This was a school project as part of my Processes for Object Oriented Programming class. We wanted to help facilitate the interaction between friends and create a game familiar with everyones childhood.

## What I learned
### Project dependencies
We made this app in react native's early days of development when dependencies where a big issue. Many depended on specific versions of Expo or the Map API used. As such, we ran into many compatibility issues and needed to learn about dependency management.

### Teammates
Some teammates may not always be up to speed with the same tech stack as you. Be fair and understanding. Learn to adapt and find ways for everyone to contribute. The success of this project can be directly attributed to how well we worked as a team, despite 2/4 members not being CS majors.

### Agile Development
We had three major sprints for this project. We learned to create user stories and assign story points. Needless to say, we had to quickly change the amount of story points we gave as we became very anxious to build the app and impliment a bunch of _cool features_.

## Running (Warning: project is depricated)
1.  Clone repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BaileyWaldorf/Hide-N-Seek-IRL.git
    ```

2.  Install dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
4.  Start up mobile emulator or download React Native's Expo CLI
	```bash
	npm install -g expo-cli
	```
	https://expo.io/tools#client
	
5. Follow steps as part of Expo client or react native to run it on your device.
    
Please note: This app is currently unfinished and will not be fully interactible. The Firebase project is not running anymore so you'll have to make your own and connect to Firestore.
